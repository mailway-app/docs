The Mailway extension generates, in a click, temporary email addresses (that looks legit) using your own domain. Emails received after a few hours will be refused to reduce spam from bad websites.

## Underyling email routing rules

The generated email addresses are leveraging Mailway's [Incoming Email Routing].

By default, the generated rules are hidden in the dashboard.
To see and manage them check the *Show hidden rules* option.

You can continue to receive emails on a temporary address by editing the rule or deleting it.
