## Add a new sender in Mailway

In order to send emails from your domain using Mailway, you will need to create a sender account.

The sender account is used by your email client (Outlook, Gmail, Thunderbird etc) to authenticate and securely communicate with Mailway.

On the [Mailway dashboard], navigate to the `Senders` page:

Enter the address from which you want to send out the emails:

Click on `create new sender`.

The sender account's password is now visible, make sure to save it because you won't be able to see it after.
